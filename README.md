Free SIlly Games Catalogue Sample Website

Concept Outline

For my project, I want to showcase an example of a free silly game that some developers have put together and are looking to test for future release or sale, or they don’t mind sharing for no profit.  It would be like AddictingGames.com.  The entire website would be a catalogue of many games that you could choose from.  This specific website for my project would be an example of one game that you could click on and play and leave reviews or possibly a short form survey of how the player enjoyed it (or maybe give a star review, one out of five, etc.).  
I would be designing the site with Bootstrap and jQuery, and the third party library I would be using is the Mini Clip API for the game of Flip Diving: https://www.miniclip.com/webmasters/flip-diving/en/ 
For my button, I think I will try to have the review form or rating form pop up as a modal on a button click (the button would say Review Game).  I’ll also put a search bar on the navigation menu but I’m not sure if it will be functional for this project (the concept would be that you could search for new games by keyword).  
It will be a very simple page with the game as the central focus, with a simple header with our website logo, a navigation menu to get back to the catalogue, a search bar, maybe some social sharing buttons, a review button and maybe some space for ads, and it would have our company contact info in the footer.
